Hi,

I am trying to predict open_channels by training time sequenced data provided by [Kaggle University of Liverpool Ion Switching Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/liverpool-ion-switching/overview) using Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM).

You can find two different functions in my code that can help you to organize your time sequenced data to put them in correct structure for LSTM training, which allows you to select sequence length and label data (seqcreator) or just to put single column data (seqcreatorsingle) into correct shape.

I will update my Deep Learning architecture whenever I started to get good results.
